## Milestone 2a Feedback
Good work here. Your Home/Landing Page is missing in both the site map and  content strategy - what are your ideas for your landing page? Aside from this, your planning phase is well done.

Your pages, content and layout are detailed enough to provide you with a starting guide for your front end development. You may want to consider working the wireframes a little more for clearer definition as you start coding up your first layout.

Are you still planning on including a Goals page? This could probably be rolled into the Resume or Personal page.

Think carefully about how your would like to present your pictures. This will affect how you build out this page, or whether a 3rd-party gallery plugin might be an option to consider. We like [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/).

Also, give some extra thought to your main navigation menu and header. It looks like there are two menus on the Desktop wireframe, and this is likely not necessary and may be confusing for an end user. Consider streamlining this. IMO there is not enough content outlined here to necessitate drop downs.

Beware of horizontal navigation menus on mobile devices. Horizontal space on narrower devices can sometimes present a problem. A collapsed or hidden nav menu on mobile is often the way to go if space is an issue.

Your interaction flow is excellent. Based on what you outlined, driving traffic to your LinkedIn page appears to be a key goal. You can reinforce this by strategically featuring links to your profile in your content and layout.

If you want to include a search function, [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com) is probably the way to go. Unfortunately, AngularJS and custom-built search functionality is out-of scope for PWP.

Also plan to include an HTML contact form somewhere in your site. This is a PWP requirement, and will be PHP driven using Swiftmailer.

Good job here. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin development on your PWP.
